### Note :
> 1. Data scraping isn't allowed on all websites, so double check with the **`robots.txt`** on any website. [Try it out now](https://github.com/robots.txt)
>
> 2. Don't prefer web scraping at the first place, Rather make of use of `API's` which are provided by websites. 
>   For example, we can perform the same task using [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
>
> 3. If there isn't any API for a given website, then prefer going for web scraping in a ethical way.
